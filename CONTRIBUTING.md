## High Level Processes

**Getting Started**
Begin by forking this repo and submitting PRs from your local fork.

**Security Issues**
- [ ] TBD

**Features**
Issues should be opened for any significant feature work.  Please open an issue prior to working on any feature to make sure someone else isnâ€™t already working on it, and to coordinate with others on design decisions and feature progress.

**New Plugins**
- [ ] TBD

**Tests and Testing**
- [ ] TBD

**Reporting Bugs**
Please be thorough in bug reporting.  Bug reports should be specific, including as much relevant detail as possible, and reproducible, including the steps taken to reproduce the bug.  Also, please keep to a single bug per report.

If you know which area of the code is causing the bug, even better.


## Commits

### Philosophy

Commits should be made to solve either specific problems or to open future growth.  Features and feature requests should be made with growth in mind.

Your signature on any submission certifies that you are authorized to submit your patch as outlined by the below certificate.
